# HLK-LD2402 ESPHome Component

This component integrates the HLK-LD2402 24GHz radar module with ESPHome, providing presence detection, micromovement sensing, and distance measurement. It comprehensively integrates all the documented features.

The code here is generated by AI! I've taken time to make sure it all works but it may be doing very stupid stuff I don't know about. That said if not for AI support for this module may not exist at all.

The code here was developed on a module running v3.5.5 firmware. During development there were various incongruities and undocumented features that have been worked around or in to this component. My intended application uses an ESP8266 so the code here is written with that in mind, if you are using another board remember to change things accordingly. 

Version G - that is, HLK-LD2402G includes an LD which allows this module to run from 5V. Other versions should be 3.3v. The documentation for this module seems to lag behind the actual implementation and even then is only available in Chinese, it is though in this reposity should you wish to refer to it. Hilink have made various related downloads available [here](https://www.hlktech.com/en/Goods-248.html#datum). I do note that their copy of sscom5.13.1 was flagged by virus total and the sandboxing picked up some fairly creepy behaviour, and it's superfluous anyway, so just avoid it. The LD2402G specific tool was clean but do always run it against virus total or use it in a sandboxed environment. 

This module is the only one i've seen that implements a kind of adjustable calibration, where it will tune the thresholds to a baseline sensitivity. The power interference check is also pretty cool. It does run hot to the touch. 

We'll be using the ESP8266 TX/RX pins for this so don't forget to disable uart logging!
   ```yaml
logger:
  baud_rate: 0

- First setting up the device
- Calibrating the radar
- Fine-tuning detection thresholds
- Troubleshooting detection issues

### Minimal Configuration
After your device is properly calibrated and configured, switch to the minimal configuration (`hlk_ld2402_minimal.yaml`) which includes only:

## Calibration Guide

### When to Calibrate
- After initial installation
- When changing the radar's mounting position
- After significant changes to the room layout
- If experiencing false detections or missed detections

### Calibration Procedure
1. Ensure the room is empty of people and moving objects
2. Press "Calibrate" button
3. Wait for calibration to complete (10-15 seconds)
4. Press "Save Config" to store calibration permanently

### Advanced Calibration
For environments with special requirements:
1. Adjust the sensitivity multipliers based on your needs:
   - Lower values (1.0-2.0): Higher sensitivity, good for large rooms
   - Medium values (2.0-4.0): Balanced detection, suitable for most rooms
   - Higher values (4.0+): Lower sensitivity, reduces false positives
2. Press "Generate Thresholds with Sensitivity Inputs"
3. Wait for completion
4. Press "Save Config"

## Threshold Management

Each distance "gate" (0.7m segment) has independent threshold settings for:
- Motion detection (larger movements)
- Micromotion detection (subtle movements)

### Threshold Adjustment
You can modify individual gate thresholds:
1. Switch to complete configuration
2. Adjust the slider for the specific gate and type (motion/micromotion)
3. Press "Save Config" to store changes

### Recommended Threshold Values
- Motion thresholds: 40-60 dB (lower = more sensitive)
- Micromotion thresholds: 35-50 dB (lower = more sensitive)
- Gates farther from the sensor typically need lower thresholds

## Engineering Mode

Engineering mode provides direct access to raw radar data for advanced troubleshooting and calibration.

### Using Engineering Mode
1. Press "Set Engineering Mode"
2. View real-time energy values for each distance gate
3. The readings show reflected signal strength in dB
4. Higher values indicate stronger reflections (potential detection)
5. Return to normal mode by pressing "Set Normal Mode"

### Interpreting Energy Values
- Background noise: Typically 10-25 dB
- Human presence: Usually causes 10-30 dB increase above background
- Values consistently above threshold trigger detection
- Compare energy values to threshold values to understand detection behavior

## Common Issues & Solutions

### No Detection / Poor Range
- **Check power supply** - The module requires clean 3.3V or 5V power
- **Run Auto Gain** - Adjusts amplification for your environment
- **Lower thresholds** for affected gates
- **Verify installation height** - Should be 1.5-2.0m for wall mount, 2.7-3.0m for ceiling

### False Detections
- **Recalibrate** with room empty
- **Increase thresholds** for problematic gates
- **Check for moving objects** (curtains, plants near vents)
- **Check for electronic interference** - Keep away from Wi-Fi routers, motors

### Detection Stops After Motion
- **Check timeout setting** - Increase if detection drops too quickly
- **Verify micromotion thresholds** - Lower for better static detection

### Power Interference Warnings
- **Use a clean power supply** - Linear power supply or good quality LDO
- **Add capacitors** to power input (100μF + 0.1μF recommended)
- **Separate power supply** from noisy components (motors, relays)

### Configuration Doesn't Save
- **Ensure Save Config completes** successfully
- **Check logs for error messages**
- **Reset the module** if persisting
